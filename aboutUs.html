        <h3>About our Group Name History</h3>
        <p>- The name of our organization is determined by key days in the year 2022. Our group had an idea when one of our team members suggested that we name ourselves Group 22 in honor of the date 22 February 2022, which occurred this year. When we initially interacted on canvas, our group was assigned slot 22, which is being utilized to build up the name of our project.</p>
        <h3>Our team information</h3>
        <p>Bui Quang Man - S3891749</p>
            <p>Nguyen Ngoan - S</p>
            <p>Dinh Khang - S</p>
            <p>Thu Nhan - S</p>
            <p>Quang Minh - S</p>

        <h3>Group Process</h3>
        <p>
            Everyone appears worried before the start of the assignment because of the difficulty of the project that the professor has assigned. Everything seemed to be straightforward since our initial conversation via voice chat, notably Discord Apps, which we utilized to hold a meeting. We chose to vote for Ngoan to become a Leader after a quick examination of the most important jobs. Ngoan answered to the majority of our due responsibilities. Besides, we opted to do it collaboratively on Github, which we had previously done in class, and everything went well.
        </p>
        <h3>Career Plans</h3>
        <p>The majority of our group members have their own professional plans. Khang and Minh, for example, are proficient at MySql and Python since he took several other courses on these topics before applying to RMIT. Furthermore, Ngoan, Man, and Nhan appear to be engaged in web development, which may explain how they were able to complete this assignment effectively. Regardless of our differences, we divided the assignment into several tiny jobs and then decided to distribute it to every single member who has the ability to do it as fast as possible.
